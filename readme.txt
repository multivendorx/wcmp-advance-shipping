A free addon bridging WC Marketplace and WC Table Rate Shipping.

== Description ==

Transform your marketplace store into a perfect drop-shiping module.

WCMp Advance Shipping is a WooCommerce/WCMp addon which bridges [Table Rate Shipping](https://www.woothemes.com/products/table-rate-shipping/) 
by Woothemes and [WC Marketplace](https://wordpress.org/plugins/dc-woocommerce-multi-vendor/). The plugin allows vendors to create multiple shipping rates
based on location, price, weight and item count.  

You might find that some of default features available within Table Rate Shipping are disabled while using the WCMp Advance Shipping plugin. This is done 
to ensure that vendors don't gain  unnecessary access which might compromise the integrity of WC Marketplace. Some of the disabled options include:

* Admin option for Shipping rate Calculation Type - Calculated rates per shipping class
* Vendor option for Shipping table rate(s) condition - Item count(same class)
* Vendor option for Shipping table rate(s) - Break, Abort
